What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates hidden .git directory to contain metadata aboue the various commits.  Without initializing a git repository, the directory is just a regular directory without any version tracking.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area contains the file or files from the working directory that will be added to the git repository.   The user explicity tells Git which files to add to the repository but adding them to the staging area.  Other files in the working directory are not tracked by Git.
